/**
 * This is a solution to the <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ishaan-and-sticks/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks Easy Ishaan andSticks</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given a set of stick lengths, determine the largest area square that can be made.
 * Print the area, as well as the quantity of squares that can be made with this area.
 * 
 * I'm including this in my collection because of its use of a HashMap and it shows how to iterate through it concisely.
