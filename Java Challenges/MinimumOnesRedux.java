/**
 * This is a solution to the <a href="http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/row-with-minimum-number-of-1s/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks School Row with minimum number of 1's.</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Print the index of the row of the matrix that has the least number of 1's in it.
 * If no rows have a 1 then print -1.
 * If more than one row has the same number of minimum 1s the print the lowest index.
 * 
 * This was redone because I realized I didn't need to actually construct the matrix, 
 * I just needed to keep track of an index and a count.
 * 
 * I'm including this challenge because I like how it made me think about the matrix and how to count
 * specific elements by row.
