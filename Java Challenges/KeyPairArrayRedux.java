/**
 * This is a solution to the <a href="http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/key-pair/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks Easy Key Pair</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given an array of numbers, and another number X, determine if two numbers in the array sum to X.
 * This solution uses an array with a time complexity of O(n) if the range is known.
 * 
 * What is happening is an array of booleans is created with the same size as the range of the inputs (+1 because index starts at 0 )
 * When an integer is given for the array, that means that that integer is present - this is the key.
 * So use that element's value as the index to the boolean array and set that to true - because this element exists within the array.
 * 
 * Now, to find the actual pair...
 * 
 * Subtract the element from the given sum.
 * The remainder is the difference. This is the number we want to see if it is in the array.
 * If the DIFFERENCE exists within the boolean array this implies that the sum can be found.
 * So just check if booleanArray [ difference ] == true.
 * If so, then the pair is the element in the array: arr[ i ] and DIFFERENCE.
 * 
 * I'm including this because it is the most efficient solution to the challenge
