/**
 * This is a solution to the <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-the-string-in-descending-order/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks Basic Sort the string in descending order</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given a string sort the characters in descending order.
 * 
 * Since my other solution was too slow I found this solution on GFG and thought it looked elegant.
 * 
 * I'm including this challenge because it shows how to use a StringBuffer to print a char[] array in reverse.
