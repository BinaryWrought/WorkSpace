 * This is a solution to the <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/product-is-even-or-odd/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks Basic Even or Odd</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given two numbers, determine if their product is even or odd.
 * Print 1 for even 0 for odd.
 * 
 * I'm including this just because of its use of BigInteger. That class always trips me up.
