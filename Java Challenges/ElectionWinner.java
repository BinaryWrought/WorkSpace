 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given an array of strings print the word that appears the most and its count, or if there is a tie, lexicographically first.
 * 
 * I'm including this one because it shows use of a tree map and I get the highest count AND lexicographically first value
 * by comparing elements where the count is STRICTLY greater than.
