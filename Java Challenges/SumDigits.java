/**
 * This is a solution to the <a href="http://" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks </a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given an integer, sum its digits and print the result.
 * 
 * I'm including this challenge because it shows how to use mod 10 to sum the digits of an integer.
 * I really need to remember this technique because I know I've converted an integer to a string
 * and iterated through its chars parsing as ints too many times. I should have used this technique all along.
