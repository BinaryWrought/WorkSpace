 * This is a solution to the <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-number-of-elements-between-two-given-elements-in-array/0" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks Basic Count number of elements between two given elements in array</a>
 * 
 * To summarize the challenge:
 * Given an array of integers and two integers count the number of elements between the two given integers (excluding the given numbers.)
 * In the case where there is more than one of each given element, consider the leftmost occurrence for the first number and the rightmost occurrence for the second.
 * 
 * I'm including this challenge because I like how it made me think about ranges within an array.
